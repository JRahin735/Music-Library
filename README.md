# Music-Library
Creating a music library search system using C++ maps and sets

Project Summary: 

Music libraries are everywhere in our lives. Whether we have personal libraries or live in Spotify the ability to load, store, display, and alter the information is at the backend of every system. Additionally, users must be able to effectively search massive libraries of music to discover what they are looking for. In this project, you will recreate a piece of this technology by using the map and set abstractions to build a music library search engine that can find album titles that match a user's query in addition to implementing some basic library interactions. 


This is a simplified version of a music library as we strip away graphical interfaces and some of the interactions that might seem useful to help pair down the project. In our version, the music database files will have album titles, artists, and songs. Every music data file is set up the same way, and our system has a series of commands to interact with the data files (load & export) as well as displaying information about the data once it is in the program.

This project was done as a part of CS 251 at UIC during Spring '23 taught under Prof. Adam Kohler.
